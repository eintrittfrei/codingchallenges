# codingchallenges
This was a recent coding challenge for a technical interview. The interview didn'g go too well so I decided to figure this out afterwards. 
The challenge:
Imagine a superarket total to be paid. The customer will hand a note of 50. Write a function to work out how many bills and coins will be returne to the customer. bills and couins available: 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01
Return matching change for a total of 16.06
